      <button id="accordion-button-1" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"Why has European Type Approval for towbars been introduced?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Directive 94/20/EC was introduced as part of EWVTA to provide a common standard throughout the European Community, thus creating an open market. Irrespective of where a towbar has been Type Approved, a customer will know that it has been manufactured to a known technical and quality standard.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-2" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"What happens if I don't fit a Type Approved towbar?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>If your car is first registered on or after the 1st August 1998, you could be prosecuted for an infringement of Construction and Use Regulations or your Insurers may decline to pay out in the event of an accident claim.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-3" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"I only tow a small trailer on rare occasions, surely I don't need a type approved towbar?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The towbar must be certified even if not used for towing! Otherwise it does not comply with the Road Traffic Act.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-4" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"I am changing my car, can I fit the towbar from my old car onto my new car?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Not unless you are purchasing the same make and model of car and your towbar is type approved.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"Is the towing capacity relevant to my car or towbar?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The towing capacity is relevant to your vehicle and all vehicles have varying towing capacities.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"Can I transfer my non approved towbar from my 1996 Vauxhall Vectra to the new Vectra I am getting after August 1998 if I fit it myself?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>No. Only Type Approved Towbars can be fitted to vehicles that are registered on or after the 1st August 1998.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"Does 94/20/EC mean that I can only have a swan neck towbar fitted as supplied by the vehicle manufacturer?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>No. A towbar with the popular two hole faceplate and towball made by an independant towbar manufacturer can be EC Type Approved.</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"How long does it take to have a towbar fitted?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>It can take anything from 30 minutes to 4 hours to fit a towbar as fitting times vary with each bar.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"I have a Ford Ka and want to tow my small trailer but nobody lists a towbar. Can I have one specially manufactured?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>No. When EC Type Approving the vehicle, the manufacturer did not declare that it was suitable for towing. It therefore has no specified towing capacity and no specified mounting points. Towing with, or even the fitment of a towbar to any such vehicle registered on or after the 1st August 1998 would make you liable to prosecution.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"Can I fit a Type Approved towbar myself or do I have to go to an authorised dealer?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Yes. You can fit the towbar yourself provided that it is installed in accordance with the instructions provided, but you may prefer a specialist to carry out the installation to include the often awkward towing electrics.</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"Where are the electrics wired to?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>In most the electrics are wired directly to the vehicles rear lights.</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"How can I tell if a towbar is EC Type Approved?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>It will have a label, data plate or staming showing an "E" No e.g. E11*0001*00. This figure denotes that it is EC Approved in the UK (E11), has an approval number (0001), of EC Document revision 0.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"I am towing a small trailer for my jet ski, what type of electrics will I need?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>You will require single electrics in order to power the normal tail / side lights, indicator, brake and fog lights.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"When would you require double electrics?"</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Double electrics are needed when towing a caravan to supply power to the fridge and battery as well as taking a 12v feed into the caravan for interior lights etc. A split charge relay can also be added to double electrics to prevent your car battery being drained by your caravan.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">"My local motor dealer says that my warranty will be invalidated unless I fit the manufacturer's towbar."</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>94/20/EC was designed to create free trade. If you fit a Type Approved towbar it will not invalidate the vehicle warranty. Under EC Block Exemption rules, a motor vehicle manufacturer cannot prevent a franchised outlet from supplying or fitting components deemed to be of equal quality to that supplied by the vehicle manufacturer - such as a Type Approved towbar.</p>

        <p style="margin-top:8px">The actual, exact and only towing capacity figure that should be used for your vehicle is that which is stamped on the Vehicle Identification Number Plate, VIN Plate.
        <br>
        The VIN plate can usually be found under the bonnet or on a door pillar and details of the location will be in the ownerâ€™s handbook. The plate will be either an alloy plate riveted to the body or a sticker.
<br>
The VIN plate will display either 3 or 4 sets of weight, it is these weights that the authorities use to determine whether your vehicle is over-laden.
